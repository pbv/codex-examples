# Codex-examples

Samples exercises for [Codex](https://github.com/pbv/codex), a web 
system for programming exercises.

## Overview

Exercise descriptions are written as human-readable Markdown files (`.md`)
using extensions supported by the [Pandoc library](https://pandoc.org/).

Depending on the type of tester,  extra files are needed
for *doctests* files, Haskell property scripts or input/output test cases.
Check the
[userguide](https://rawgit.com/pbv/codex/master/doc/USER-GUIDE.html)
for details.

## Remark

Github will attempt to display Markdown files (`.md`) as HTML and
directly; this will *not* corretly show many of the Pandoc extensions
or the metadata.  Please view raw files to see the full document.
