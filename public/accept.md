# Remove temporary files

Write a *shell* script that removes all temporary files 
generated by executing the LaTeX command, namely:

~~~
*.aux
*.toc
*.bbl
*.blg
*.log
~~~

Your *script* should accept a single command line argument: 
the name of the directory to remove files from.

**Your submission will *not* be automatically checked!**
